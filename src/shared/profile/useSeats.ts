/**
 * React binding for a game's chairs: seeds them from the remembered lineup
 * (or the signed-in ticket), hands back the roster for the strip, and
 * `remember()` writes the lineup when the game actually starts — a picker
 * left half-filled and abandoned changes nothing for next time.
 *
 * Until someone touches a chair the table derives live from the lineup, so a
 * game that asks "how many?" after mounting (Magic Coins, Risk's count row)
 * still restores every remembered chair. Once touched, a bigger table keeps
 * what was chosen and fills the new chairs from the lineup.
